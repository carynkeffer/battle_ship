# DTR: Define the Relationship

Project: **Battle Ship**

Group Member Names: **Joe Budina and Caryn Keffer**

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): **Joe would like to broaden his horizons of object oriented programming. Caryn would like to continue learning the technical skills required as well as understanding the basics of collaborating with others. What do we want to achieve as a team? We want to see what it's like to achieve a running program, to enjoy a collaborative process, and feel confident in our collective abilities to come together to make something. How will we know that we're successful? We will know we are successful by asking ourselves questions, are we creating this with a good understanding of the content? Checking in, and updating progress. One goal is to prevent burnout by taking care of ourselves and checking in with each other to make sure our needs are met.**

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): **We feel that we are aligned in that we are both looking to and excited to problem solve. We both bring enthusiasm and passion to the start of the project. We both value honesty and with that being said we are establishing a style of open communication. A goal is to keep each other accountable in moving forward productively. We're identifying a challenge with not being given the full specifications of the project.**

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: **When in doubt, ask questions. Regardless of the complexity of the problem, we will find a way to persist.**

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section): **NOT TUESDAY but we are establishing an open line of communication in order to prioritizing our project 1-3 hours every day.**

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?): **We will be in communication every day via slack, but we're open to texting if we need to as a backup. We will approach problems as a team by talking through the problem at hand, and walking through things together. We agree to trust each other to express our needs and take responsibility for our own well-being, for the sake of success.**

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): **Joe is getting better at using pry and feels really good about writing tests. Joe admittedly is working his way through methods,  knowing how to approach methods. Caryn's strengths are understanding concepts. Caryn's weakness is putting things in practice, and applying what she knows.**

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): **We would both like to work on practicing the technical skills we've learned so far through collaborating.**

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): **We will do our best to split workflow expectations, given the circumstance and technology.**

Pomodoro Break Schedule: **We will stick to poms as much as possible, give or take 20 mins when needed to work out a problem.**

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: **We expect to be totally honest and kind.**

Additional Remote Considerations: **Being aware of the circumstances in: Technology, internet connection, time zone differences, time spent not at home.**

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools): **We're working on refining our communication skills.**
