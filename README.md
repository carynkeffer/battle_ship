# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.*

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
* How would you describe your work style?
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: **Battle Ship**

Group Member Names: **Joe Budina and Caryn Keffer**

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): **Joe would like to broaden his horizons of object oriented programming. Caryn would like to continue learning the technical skills required as well as understanding the basics of collaborating with others. What do we want to achieve as a team? We want to see what it's like to achieve a running program, to enjoy a collaborative process, and feel confident in our collective abilities to come together to make something. How will we know that we're successful? We will lknnow we are successful by asking ourselves quesstions, are we creating this with a good understanding of the content? Checking in, and updating progress. One goal is to preent burnout by taking care of ourselves and checking in with each other to make sure our needs are met.**

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): **We feel that we are aligned in that we are both looking to and excited to problem solve. We both bring enthusium and passion to the start of the project. We both value honesty and with that being said we are establishing a style of open communication. A goal is to keep each other accountable in moving forward productively. We're identifying a challenge with not being given the full specifications of the project.**

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: **When in doubt, ask questions. Regardless of the complexity of the problem, we will find a way to persist.**

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section): **NOT TUESDAY but we are establishing an open line of communication in order to priotizing our project 1-3 hours every day.**

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?): **We will be in communication every day via slack, but we're open to texting if we need to as a backup. We will approach problems as a team by talking through the problem at hand, and walking through things together. We agree to trust each other to express our needs and take responsibility for our own well-being, for the sake of success.**

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): **Joe is getting better at using pry and feels really good about writing tests. Joe admittedly is working his way through methods,  knowing how to approach methods. Caryn's strengths are understanding concepts. Caryn's weakness is putting things in practice, and applying what she knows.**

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): 

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Pomodoro Break Schedule:

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
